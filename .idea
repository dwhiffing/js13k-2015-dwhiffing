JS13k Glitch Metroidvania

  each upgrade has simple implementation which allows for user to exploit mechanics

  exploits should all be discovered and fixed just enough to allow for controlled exploitation

  levels should be designed to encourage the player to use these exploits

  upgrades will change existing mechanics to remove/change existing exploits and add new ones

  beginning of game will have linear levels to introduce this mechanic, then open a more non linear space
